## Development of a Customer Churn Prediction Model
### Description:
- The telecommunications operator wants to learn how to predict customer churn. If it is determined that a user plans to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special conditions. The operator's team has collected personal data about some customers, as well as information about their tariffs and contracts.

- The cost of marketing expenses to regain a lost customer is quite high; it is cheaper to retain the customer. Therefore, the company's management has assigned our team the task of developing a customer churn prediction model.

### Objective:
- The objective of our project is to develop a customer churn prediction model using binary classification task, available data, and supervised learning methods. We aim to achieve an AUC-ROC metric value of at least 0.85 on the test dataset.

### Tools:
- Python, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, LightGBM, Keras

### tags
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Preprocessing Data, Machine learning
