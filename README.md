    <td>The bank is experiencing a steady but noticeable decline in customer retention. To address this issue, the marketing team has determined that it's more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. Hence, the aim of this project is to build a customer churn prediction model. The model will utilize historical data on customer behavior and contract terminations to forecast whether a customer is likely to leave the bank in the near future.</td>

    <td>The telecom operator aims to predict customer churn and provide incentives to customers intending to leave. They have gathered personal data, tariff information, and contract details. The objective of this project is to develop a churn prediction model using binary classification and supervised learning techniques with the available data.</td>
